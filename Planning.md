### **Part 1: Where We Are Right Now (Current Status)**

We have successfully built the entire core foundation of the editor. This is the most complex part, and it is **95% complete**.

**‚úÖ Achievements Unlocked:**

- **Plugin Foundation:** The Bubble plugin element is fully configured with all necessary properties (inputs), exposed states (outputs), and actions.
- **Editor Renders:** The Tiptap editor correctly appears inside the plugin element, isolated by a Shadow DOM to prevent CSS conflicts.
- **Dynamic Content Loading:** The plugin successfully makes an API call to the mock backend using a `document_id` and renders the fetched content.
- **Content Saving:** The plugin can send the editor's current content back to the mock backend via a "Save" action, completing the full data cycle.
- **Slash Command Appears:** The `/` command successfully triggers the Tiptap `Suggestion` utility, and a popup menu **visually appears** on the screen.

**üìç The Final Blocker for this Phase:**

- **Slash Command Interactivity:** The menu that appears is not interactive. Clicks and key presses do not execute the commands.
- **Root Cause:** This is a stubborn file caching issue. The CDN (`jsDelivr`) is serving an old, broken version of `suggestion.js` to your browser, even though the code in your GitHub repository is correct.

### **Part 2: The Immediate Next Step (The Fix)**

Our **only goal right now** is to force the browser to load the correct, latest version of the JavaScript files. We will use the "Version Beacon" strategy from our last message.

**Phase 3, Step 2 (FIX): Verify File Loading & Finalize Slash Command**

1.  **Update JS with Version Beacons:** Ensure your `suggestion.js` and `editor-core.js` files in your local project contain the `_version: "1.1"` property and the `console.log("... v1.1 loaded");` line at the very top. The full, correct code for `suggestion.js` is in our previous message.
2.  **Commit & Push:** Commit and push these updated files to GitHub.
3.  **Get New Commit Hash:** Copy the new, unique hash from the commit you just made.
4.  **Update HTML Header:** In the Bubble plugin editor, update the URLs for `suggestion.js` and `editor-core.js` with this new hash.
5.  **‚û°Ô∏è VERIFY THE FIX (The Critical Action):**
    - Open your Bubble app in preview mode.
    - Open the browser's developer console (F12).
    - **Look for these exact lines in the console:**
      ```
      suggestion.js v1.1 loaded
      editor-core.js v1.1 loaded
      ```
    - **If you see `v1.1` for both**, the slash command menu will now be fully interactive. The problem is solved.
    - **If you do not see `v1.1`**, the CDN cache is the confirmed problem. Immediately proceed to the "Nuclear Option": temporarily use the `raw.githubusercontent.com` URL for the scripts in your header to bypass the cache and prove the code works.

Once this step is complete, the core editor functionality will be finished.

### **Part 3: The Complete Project Plan (The Roadmap)**

This is the full plan from start to finish.

#### **Phase 1: Foundation & Static Editor (‚úÖ DONE)**

- **Deliverables:**
  - ‚úÖ Bubble plugin element configured (properties, states, actions).
  - ‚úÖ Tiptap libraries loaded via CDN.
  - ‚úÖ Editor rendering inside a Shadow DOM.
  - ‚úÖ Display of static, hardcoded content.

#### **Phase 2: Dynamic Data & Core Functionality (‚úÖ DONE)**

- **Deliverables:**
  - ‚úÖ Mock backend server created (Node.js/Express).
  - ‚úÖ Modular JS architecture (`api-bridge`, `bubble-bridge`).
  - ‚úÖ Dynamic content loading from the backend via `document_id`.
  - ‚úÖ Content saving back to the backend via a "Save" action.

#### **Phase 3: Core UX - Slash Command Menu (üìç WE ARE HERE)**

- **Deliverables:**
  - ‚úÖ Tiptap `Suggestion` utility implemented.
  - ‚úÖ Popup menu appears when typing `/`.
  - ‚û°Ô∏è **(Current Task)** Finalize interactivity by resolving the file caching issue.

#### **Phase 4: Advanced Features - Image Handling & MinIO**

- **Goal:** Allow users to upload images directly into the editor, storing them in your self-hosted MinIO instance.
- **Steps:**
  1.  **Backend:** Create a new `/api/images/upload` endpoint in your Node.js server. This endpoint will use `multer` to process the file upload and the `minio` SDK to save the file to your MinIO bucket. It will return the public URL of the saved image.
  2.  **Frontend:** Implement a custom Tiptap Image extension. When a user drops an image or selects one from a file input, this extension will:
      - Create a temporary placeholder in the editor (e.g., a blurred preview).
      - Call `ApiBridge.uploadImage()` to send the file to your backend.
      - Once the backend returns the MinIO URL, update the image placeholder's `src` attribute with the final URL.

#### **Phase 5: Polishing & Advanced UX**

- **Goal:** Replicate more of Notion's signature UI/UX features.
- **Potential Features:**
  1.  **Floating Bubble Menu:** A small toolbar that appears when text is selected, offering options like Bold, Italic, Link, etc. This is a standard Tiptap feature.
  2.  **Custom Blocks for Linked Components:** Create a custom Tiptap node that represents a "linked component" from your Bubble database, making your editor deeply integrated with your app's data.
  3.  **Drag and Drop Blocks:** Implement drag-and-drop functionality to reorder blocks within the editor.

#### **Phase 6: Production & Deployment**

- **Goal:** Move from a mock environment to a live, production-ready system.
- **Steps:**
  1.  **Backend Migration:** Replace the mock Node.js server with your real, production backend. Connect it to your production PostgreSQL database and MinIO instance.
  2.  **Authentication:** Implement real security, passing the user's Bubble authentication token with every API request and verifying it on the backend.
  3.  **Final Testing:** Conduct thorough end-to-end testing of all features in the live Bubble environment.
